# Network Traffic Scenarios for Educational Demonstrations

This directory contains sample network scenarios and traffic generators designed for educational cybersecurity exercises. These tools help students learn to identify various network security threats and patterns.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Network Activity Generator
```bash
# Run basic network scenario
python samples/network-scenarios/basic_network_activity.py

# Generate suspicious traffic patterns
python samples/network-scenarios/suspicious_traffic_generator.py

# Simulate backdoor communication
python samples/network-scenarios/backdoor_simulation.py
```

### Monitoring the Scenarios
```bash
# Monitor while running scenarios
python src/analyzer/network_cli.py --monitor-connections --educational

# Capture traffic during scenarios
python src/analyzer/network_cli.py --capture-traffic --duration 60 --educational
```

## üìÇ Scenario Categories

### 1. Basic Network Activity
- **Purpose**: Establish baseline network behavior for comparison
- **File**: `basic_network_activity.py`
- **Activities**: Normal web requests, DNS queries, legitimate service connections

### 2. Suspicious Traffic Patterns
- **Purpose**: Generate network patterns that indicate potential security threats
- **File**: `suspicious_traffic_generator.py`
- **Activities**: Port scanning, unusual connection patterns, data exfiltration simulation

### 3. Backdoor Communication
- **Purpose**: Simulate backdoor/malware network communication patterns
- **File**: `backdoor_simulation.py`
- **Activities**: C&C communication, reverse shells, data tunneling

### 4. DNS-based Threats
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate DNS-based attack patterns and detection
- **File**: `dns_threat_scenarios.py`
- **Activities**: DNS tunneling, DGA patterns, malicious domain queries

### 5. Service Discovery Attacks
- **Purpose**: Show how attackers discover and exploit network services
- **File**: `service_discovery_attacks.py`
- **Activities**: Port scanning, service enumeration, vulnerability probing

## üéØ Educational Objectives

Students will learn to:
1. **Recognize normal vs. suspicious network patterns**
2. **Identify common attack signatures in network traffic**
3. **Use network analysis tools effectively**
4. **Document security findings professionally**
5. **Understand the importance of network monitoring**

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety and Ethics

### Educational Use Only
- These scenarios are designed for educational purposes in controlled environments
- All activities should be conducted only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Do not use these tools against systems you do not own

### Responsible Disclosure
- If you discover real vulnerabilities during exercises, report them responsibly
- Follow your organization's security policies and procedures
- Never exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
```bash
# Python packages
pip install requests scapy python-nmap psutil

# System tools (if available)
# nmap, netcat, curl, ping, nslookup
```

### Environment Setup
1. Ensure you're running in the Docker sandbox environment
2. All scenarios run on localhost to prevent network interference
3. Use educational mode for all tools: `--educational` flag

## üìù Usage Instructions

### For Instructors
1. **Review each scenario** before class to understand expected outputs
2. **Test network monitoring tools** to ensure they detect scenario activities
3. **Prepare discussion points** about each security pattern demonstrated
4. **Have backup plans** if certain network tools are not available

### For Students
1. **Start network monitoring** before running scenarios
2. **Document all findings** using provided worksheets
3. **Compare patterns** between different scenario types
4. **Ask questions** about anything you don't understand

## üîç Expected Learning Outcomes

After completing these exercises, students should be able to:
- Distinguish between legitimate and suspicious network activity
- Use command-line network analysis tools effectively
- Generate professional security assessment reports
- Explain common network-based attack patterns
- Recommend appropriate security controls and monitoring strategies

## üìä Integration with Other Modules

### SAST Integration
- Use static analysis to identify network-related vulnerabilities in source code
- Look for hardcoded IPs, insecure protocols, and poor input validation

### DAST Integration  
- Combine network monitoring with dynamic application testing
- Observe network traffic generated by web application security tests

### Sandbox Integration
- Monitor network activity of suspicious applications in the sandbox
- Correlate behavioral analysis with network communication patterns

## üéì Assessment Criteria

Students will be assessed on:
1. **Technical accuracy** of network analysis findings
2. **Quality of documentation** and reporting
3. **Understanding of security implications** 
4. **Ability to recommend** appropriate countermeasures
5. **Professional presentation** of results

**Note**: These scenarios are designed to work in a Codespaces/Docker environment with limited network access. They focus on localhost traffic and simulated patterns that students can observe and analyze safely.
