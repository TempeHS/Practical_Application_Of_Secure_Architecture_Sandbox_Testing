If not in correct directory:
```bash
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment
```

### 2. Docker Applications Status Check
```bash
# Check vulnerable applications are running
curl -s http://localhost:5000/index.html
curl -s http://localhost:9090/index.html

curl -s http://localhost:8000/index.html
```
**Expected**: HTML content or 200 responses

If applications not responding:
```bash
cd docker && docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment
# Wait 30 seconds for startup
