### 2. Docker Container Setup

- Create a Dockerfile that:
  - Uses a base Ubuntu image
  - Installs necessary security tools (OWASP ZAP, Nikto, etc.)
  - Configures a controlled environment
  - Installs required dependencies (Python, Node.js)
  - Sets appropriate permissions and security boundaries

- Create a docker-compose.yml to manage:
  - The sandbox container
  - Any supporting services (database, web server)
  - Network isolation
  - Volume mounting for persistent data

### 3. Sandbox Implementation

- Develop Python scripts to:
  - Launch applications within the sandbox
  - Monitor system calls and network activity
  - Detect potential malicious behavior
  - Enforce resource limitations
  - Log all activities for review

### 4. Security Analysis Components

- Implement basic security testing tools:
  - Static code analysis (for detecting obvious vulnerabilities)
  - Network traffic monitoring
  - Input validation testing
  - Basic fuzzing capabilities
  - Configuration analysis

- Focus on educational aspects with clear output rather than comprehensive detection

### 5. Report Generation

- Create a reporting module that:
  - Summarizes detected issues
  - Categorizes findings by severity
  - Provides explanations suitable for high school students
  - Includes remediation suggestions
  - Generates HTML or PDF reports

### 6. Sample Applications

- Develop or adapt deliberately vulnerable applications:
  - A simple web application with common OWASP Top 10 issues
  - Basic scripts with security flaws
  - Ensure vulnerabilities are obvious and educational

### 7. Documentation

- Create comprehensive documentation in the /docs folder:
  - Setup instructions for instructors
  - User guides for students
  - Explanation of security concepts
  - Sample lesson plans
  - Exercise worksheets

### 8. Testing

- Test all components thoroughly:
  - Ensure sandbox containment works properly

  - Confirm reports generate correctly
  - Test on Codespaces environment

## Educational Considerations

- Keep content appropriate for high school students
- Focus on foundational security concepts
- Provide clear explanations of vulnerabilities and risks
- Include guided exercises with increasing difficulty levels
- Ensure ethical considerations are addressed

## Limitations and Scope

- This is an educational tool, not a production-grade sandbox
- Security containment has practical limitations in a Codespaces environment
- Analysis capabilities are intentionally basic to focus on learning
