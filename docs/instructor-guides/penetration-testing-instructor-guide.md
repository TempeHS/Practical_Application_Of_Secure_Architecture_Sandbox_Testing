## üìñ Detailed Lesson Plan

### Introduction and Ethics (30 minutes)

#### Opening Discussion Questions
1. "What is the difference between ethical hacking and malicious hacking?"
2. "Why do organizations hire penetration testers?"
3. "What legal protections do penetration testers need?"

#### Key Concepts to Cover
- **Penetration Testing Definition**: Authorized testing of systems to find vulnerabilities
- **Ethical Hacking Principles**: Permission, scope, documentation, responsibility, no harm
- **Legal Framework**: Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, local laws, organizational policies
- **Professional Standards**: Industry certifications, responsible disclosure, client relationships

#### Demonstration: Real-World Case Studies
Present 2-3 brief case studies showing:
- Successful penetration testing that improved security
- Legal consequences of unauthorized access
- Ethical dilemmas faced by security professionals

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance (45 minutes)

#### Instructor Demonstration (15 minutes)
```bash
# Show systematic information gathering
python src/analyzer/network_cli.py --scan-services localhost --educational
