# DAST Instructor Guide - Dynamic Application Security Testing

## Setup

### Environment Preparation

**Pre-Class Checklist (15 minutes before class):**
```bash
# Navigate to main project directory
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment

# Start web applications for testing
cd docker && docker-compose up -d

# Verify applications are running
docker ps | grep -E "(vulnerable|unsecure)"

# Test DAST tool availability
python src/analyser/analyse_cli.py --help
```

**Student Prerequisites:**
- Basic computer literacy (file navigation, command copying)
- No programming knowledge required
- Completed SAST exercise recommended

### Class Setup
## Teaching Notes

### 🎯 Core Concepts

**What is DAST?**
- Dynamic = testing running applications like a real user
- Different from SAST which examines source code
- Tests for runtime vulnerabilities: authentication, session management, server configuration
- Like test-driving a car vs. inspecting the engine blueprints

**Key Analogies:**
- DAST = visiting websites as customers and testing security
- SAST = examining building blueprints before construction
- Both needed for comprehensive security assessment

### � Teaching Approach

**Basic Commands Students Will Use:**
```bash
# Test web application connectivity
curl http://localhost:5000
curl http://localhost:9090

# Basic DAST scanning (primary target first)
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:5000 --educational
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:9090 --educational

# Compare results
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:5000 --quick > pwa_dast.txt
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:9090 --quick > flask_dast.txt
```

**Expected Results:**
- Unsecure PWA (port 5000): 8-12 issues (missing security headers, debug mode, authentication problems)
- Flask app (port 9090): 5-8 issues (different patterns - server-side vulnerabilities, session management)

### � Hands-On Activities

**Activity 1: DAST vs SAST Understanding**
Students compare what DAST finds versus SAST results from previous exercise.

**Activity 2: Web Application Security Scanning**
Students scan both vulnerable applications and compare security profiles.

**Activity 3: Vulnerability Interpretation**
Students learn to categorise DAST findings by risk level and business impact.

### � Key Discussion Points

**DAST vs SAST Comparison:**
- SAST finds: Code vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, dependency issues
- DAST finds: Runtime configuration, authentication flaws, missing security headers
- Both needed for complete security assessment

**Common DAST Findings:**
- Missing security headers (CSRF protection, content security policy)
- Authentication bypass opportunities
- Session management vulnerabilities
- Server configuration issues

**Real-World Applications:**
- Web application penetration testing
- Compliance scanning (PCI DSS, HIPAA)
- Continuous security monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

**Web Application Problems:**
```bash
# Verify applications are running
docker ps | grep -E "(vulnerable|unsecure)"

# Restart if needed
cd docker && docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d

# Test connectivity
curl http://localhost:5000 && curl http://localhost:9090
```

**DAST Tool Issues:**
```bash
# Verify tool functionality
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py --help

# Test basic scanning
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:5000 --quick
```

### Student Support Strategies

**Varying Results:**
- Different scan timing produces different results (normal)
- Focus on vulnerability categories rather than exact counts
- Use result ranges (8-15 issues) instead of precise numbers

**Connectivity Problems:**
- Ensure correct URLs (http:// not https://)
- Verify web applications are responsive with curl
- Check Docker containers are running

**Analysis Confusion:**
- Start with high-severity findings only
- Use concrete examples (missing CSRF = form hijacking)
- Relate to real-world attack scenarios

### ❌ If Something's Wrong:

Use the troubleshooting section at the bottom of this guide

### 🎭 Simple Demonstrations for Class:

**Keep these commands ready for live demonstrations:**

```bash
# Step 1: Basic scan demo (2 minutes)
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment
 python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:9090 --quick --educational

# Step 2: Deeper scan demo (5 minutes)
 python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:9090 --deep-scan --educational

# Step 3: Multiple websites demo (3 minutes)
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py --demo-apps --educational
```

**💬 While Demonstrations Run, Explain:**

- "The tool is pretending to be an attacker testing the website"
- "It's checking for common security problems like weak passwords or missing
  protection"
- "This is safe because we're testing practice websites designed for learning"

## 📚 Exercise-by-Exercise Teaching Guide

### Exercise 1: DAST Fundamentals

#### 🎯 Key Teaching Points (Use Simple Analogies):

**What is DAST?**

- **DAST** = Testing a running website like a customer would use it
- **SAST** = Reading the code like examining building blueprints
- **Analogy**: DAST is like test-driving a car, SAST is like inspecting the car
  engine

**💻 Basic Commands for Students:**

```bash
# Step 1: Make sure you're in the main folder
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment

# Step 2: Look at the tool's options (shows what it can do)
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py --help

# Step 3: Test basic website connectivity
curl http://localhost:5000
curl http://localhost:9090
```

#### 💭 Expected Student Questions & Simple Answers:

**Q**: "Why can't DAST find hardcoded passwords?" **A**: "DAST can only see what
a website visitor sees - it can't look at the secret code behind the website."

**Q**: "Why do we need both SAST and DAST?" **A**: "It's like checking a house
by reading the blueprints AND walking through the finished house - you find
different problems each way."

#### ✅ Expected Results for Students:

- Students see the help information (tool options)
- Both practice websites respond with HTML content
- Students understand DAST tests running websites, not code

### Exercise 2: Basic Web Application Scanning

#### 🎯 Key Teaching Points (Student-Friendly):

**What Are Security Headers?**

- Like safety features on a car (seatbelts, airbags)
- Headers tell the web browser how to stay secure
- Missing headers = missing safety features

**💻 Commands for Students:**

```bash
# Step 1: Make sure you're in the main folder
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment

# Step 2: Scan the Flask practice website (takes 30-60 seconds)
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:5000 --quick --educational

# Step 3: Scan the PWA practice website (takes 30-60 seconds)
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:9090 --educational

# Step 4: Save results for comparison
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:5000 --educational > flask_security_scan.txt
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:9090 --educational > pwa_security_scan.txt
```

#### ✅ Expected Findings Students Should See:

**Flask Website** (usually 8-12 security issues):

- Missing X-Frame-Options header (protection against clickjacking)
- Missing X-Content-Type-Options header (prevents file type confusion)
- Missing X-XSS-Protection header (prevents script injection)
- Server information disclosure (reveals too much about the server)
- Debug information exposure (gives attackers helpful information)

**PWA Website** (usually 5-8 security issues):

- Missing security headers (same types as Flask)
- Session management problems (login/logout security issues)
- Redirect vulnerabilities (can send users to malicious sites)

#### 🎯 Teaching Guidance for Class:

**💬 Walk Students Through Each Finding:**

1. **Show Browser Developer Tools** (Press F12) to look at headers
2. **Explain Real-World Impact**: "Missing X-Frame-Options means malicious
   websites could embed this site in a hidden frame"
3. **Use Analogies**: "It's like having a house with no locks on the doors"

### Exercise 3: Understanding Security Vulnerabilities

#### 🎯 Key Concepts to Teach (Keep It Simple):

**What is XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)?**

- Malicious code gets injected into websites
- Like graffiti that does harmful actions when visitors see it
- Can steal passwords and personal information

**What is SQL Injection?**

- Attackers trick the database by changing requests
- Like changing a library request to check out restricted books
- Can steal all data from the database

**💻 Commands for Students to Find Evidence:**

```bash
# Step 1: Make sure you're in the main folder
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment

# Step 2: Look for XSS vulnerabilities specifically
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:5000 --educational | grep -i "xss"

# Step 3: Look for SQL injection specifically
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:5000 --educational | grep -i "sql"

# Step 4: Look for missing security headers
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:5000 --educational | grep -i "header"
```

#### 🎭 Simple Demonstrations for Class:

**Show How DAST Detects Problems** (use whiteboard or screen):

**XSS Detection:**

```
Tool sends: <script>alert('test')</script>
Website responds: Hello <script>alert('test')</script>!
Tool says: "XSS found! Script was not filtered!"
```

**SQL Injection Detection:**

```
Tool sends: ' OR 1=1--
Website responds: Database error: syntax error near OR
Tool says: "SQL injection found! Database error revealed!"
```

#### 💭 Class Discussion Questions:

**Q**: "Why are database errors dangerous to show users?" **A**: "Errors tell
attackers how the database works and confirm their attacks are working"

**Q**: "How could attackers use XSS to steal passwords?" **A**: "The malicious
script could send all typed passwords to the attacker's website"

### Exercise 4: Comparing SAST vs DAST

#### 🎯 Simple Comparison for Students:

**💻 Commands to Compare Methods:**

```bash
# Step 1: Make sure you're in the main folder
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment

# Step 2: Compare SAST (code analysis) vs DAST (website testing)
echo "=== SAST Results (Code Analysis) ==="
python src/analyser/analyse_cli.py samples/vulnerable-flask-app --educational | grep "Total findings:"

echo "=== DAST Results (Website Testing) ==="
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:5000 --quick --educational | grep "Total findings:"

# Step 3: Test multiple websites at once
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py --demo-apps --educational
```

#### 📊 Expected SAST vs DAST Comparison Table (Help Students Fill This Out):

| Security Problem             | SAST (Code)  | DAST (Website) | Why The Difference?                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **SQL Injection**            | ✅ Found     | ✅ Found       | Both methods can find this                            |
| **XSS**                      | ✅ Found     | ✅ Found       | Both methods are effective                            |
| **Missing Security Headers** | ❌ Not Found | ✅ Found       | Headers are website settings, not code                |
| **Debug Information**        | ✅ Found     | ✅ Found       | Code shows debug settings, website shows debug output |
| **Hardcoded Passwords**      | ✅ Found     | ❌ Not Found   | DAST can't see inside the code                        |

#### 💭 Class Discussion Points:

**Q**: "Why do some problems appear in both SAST and DAST?" **A**: "Some
problems can be detected by examining code AND by testing the running website"

**Q**: "Which method is better - SAST or DAST?" **A**: "Neither! They're like
different tools in a toolbox - you need both for complete security"

**Q**: "When would companies use DAST?" **A**: "Before releasing websites,
during regular security checkups, and when testing websites they didn't build"

### Exercise 5: Writing Professional Security Reports

#### 🎯 Teaching Professional Skills:

**How to Prioritise Security Problems:**

- **Critical**: Can steal data or take over the website immediately
- **High**: Can cause significant damage with some effort
- **Medium**: Security improvements that reduce risk
- **Low**: Minor issues that should be fixed when convenient

**💻 Commands for Students to Analyse Priorities:**

```bash
# Step 1: Make sure you're in the main folder
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment

# Step 2: Count high-priority issues
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:5000 --educational | grep -i "high" | wc -l

# Step 3: Count medium-priority issues
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:5000 --educational | grep -i "medium" | wc -l

# Step 4: Find the most dangerous problems
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:5000 --educational | grep -A 2 -B 2 -i "sql\|xss"
```

#### 📝 Student Report Template (Give Students This Structure):

**Professional Security Assessment Report**

1. **Executive Summary**: "We tested the Flask practice website and found \_\_\_
   security issues."

2. **Most Critical Finding**: "SQL injection vulnerability allows attackers to
   steal database information."

3. **Business Impact**: "Customer data could be stolen, leading to legal
   problems and reputation damage."

4. **Immediate Actions**:

   - Fix SQL injection (Priority 1 - this week)
   - Add security headers (Priority 2 - next week)
   - Remove debug information (Priority 3 - this month)

5. **Total Cost to Fix**: Estimate 2-4 weeks of developer time

#### ✅ Assessment Criteria for Teachers:

- Can students identify the most dangerous problems?
- Do they understand business impact beyond technical details?
- Can they write recommendations that non-technical managers would understand?
- Do they prioritise fixes based on real-world risk?

## 🚨 Simple Troubleshooting Guide

### ❌ Problem: Websites don't respond

**✅ Solution:**

```bash
# Restart the practice websites
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment/docker
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d

# Return to main folder and test
cd ..
curl http://localhost:5000
curl http://localhost:9090
```

### ❌ Problem: DAST scanner gives errors

**✅ Solution:**

```bash
# Make sure you're in the right place
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment

# Test basic connectivity first
curl -I http://localhost:5000

# Try with simpler command
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:5000 --quick
```

### ❌ Problem: Students get different results

**✅ Teaching Strategy:**

- **Normal variation**: Different scan timing can produce different results
- **Focus on concepts**: Emphasise learning about security types, not exact
  numbers
- **Use ranges**: "You should see 8-15 issues" instead of exact counts

### ❌ Problem: No security issues found

**✅ Checklist:**

- Are websites actually running? (Check with curl commands)
- Is the URL correct? (Use http:// not https://)
- Try adding --verbose flag to see what's happening

**🎯 Pro Tip**: Practice all commands yourself before class and note the typical
ranges of results to expect!
