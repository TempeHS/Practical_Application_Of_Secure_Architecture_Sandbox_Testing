# Penetration Testing - Instructor Guide

## Setup

### Environment Preparation

**Pre-Class Checklist (15 minutes before class):**
```bash
# Navigate to main project directory
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment

# Start all target applications for testing
cd docker && docker-compose up -d

# Verify penetration testing tools are available
python src/analyzer/penetration_test_cli.py --help
nmap --version

# Test connectivity to target applications
curl http://localhost:5000 && curl http://localhost:9090
```

**Critical Prerequisites:**
- Students MUST complete SAST, DAST, Network Analysis, and Sandbox exercises first
- Strong ethical framework discussion required before hands-on activities
- Written acknowledgment of authorized testing environment only

### Class Setup
- **Duration**: 4-5 hours (advanced exercise, can be split)
- **Class Size**: 8-15 students optimal for proper supervision
- **Equipment**: Individual computers with full sandbox environment

### 🚨 Most Important Rule: SAFETY AND ETHICS FIRST

**This exercise teaches real cybersecurity techniques that could be misused. As
the instructor, you MUST emphasize ethics constantly.**

#### Pre-Class Requirements (ESSENTIAL)

1. **Signed Ethics Agreement**: Every student must sign before participating
   (template provided below)
2. **Legal Explanation**: Clearly explain that unauthorized hacking is a serious
   crime
3. **Scope Boundaries**: All activities only work in our safe practice
   environment
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Watch students throughout the exercise

#### Simple Ethics Agreement Template

```
### Ethical Framework

**Before any penetration testing activities, establish clear boundaries:**

1. **Written Agreement Required**: Students must sign ethics agreement
2. **Scope Definition**: Testing limited to provided sandbox applications only
3. **No Real-World Testing**: Techniques ONLY used in authorized environment
4. **Professional Standards**: Teach responsible disclosure principles

**Student Ethics Agreement Template:**
```
I understand that penetration testing techniques are for authorized testing only.
I will never use these skills on systems without explicit permission.

## Teaching Notes

### Opening Activities (30 minutes)

**Key Discussion Points:**
- Penetration testing as security validation
- Ethical hacking vs malicious activity
- Industry use of automated and manual testing approaches
- Legal framework and professional responsibilities

**Demonstration Commands:**
```bash
# Show automated penetration testing tool
python src/analyzer/penetration_test_cli.py localhost:5000

# Demonstrate manual validation techniques
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/login" -d "username=admin' OR 1=1--&password=test"
```

### Core Activities

**Phase 1: Reconnaissance (45 minutes)**
- Students use network analysis tools for information gathering
- Focus on systematic documentation of findings
- Teach the difference between passive and active reconnaissance

**Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment (60 minutes)**
- Integration of SAST, DAST, and network findings
- Automated penetration testing tool usage
- Risk prioritization and business impact assessment

**Phase 3: Manual Testing Validation (60 minutes)**
- Manual validation of automated findings
- Advanced techniques requiring human creativity
- Comparison of automated vs manual approaches

**Phase 4: Report Generation (30 minutes)**
- Professional vulnerability reporting
- Business impact communication
- Remediation recommendations

### Assessment Methods

**Observable Skills:**
- Proper tool usage and command execution
- Systematic documentation of findings
- Understanding of risk prioritization
- Appropriate ethical decision-making

**Completion Indicators:**
- Successful execution of both automated and manual testing
- Clear comparison of testing approaches
- Professional vulnerability report generation
echo "Automated findings: [Count vulnerabilities found by automated tool]"
echo "Manual additional findings: [Count additional vulnerabilities found manually]"
echo "Total time: Automated [X] minutes vs Manual [Y] minutes"
```

**Discussion Questions for Students:**

1. **Efficiency**: "Which approach found vulnerabilities faster?"
2. **Coverage**: "Which approach found more vulnerabilities?"
3. **Depth**: "Which approach gave more detailed information about vulnerabilities?"
4. **False Positives**: "Which approach had more false alarms?"
5. **Business Logic**: "Which approach better understood the application's specific risks?"

#### Professional Workflow Development (10 minutes)

**Teach students the professional approach:**

1. **Phase 1**: Start with automated tools for rapid baseline assessment
2. **Phase 2**: Analyze automated results to prioritize manual testing targets
3. **Phase 3**: Use manual testing to validate and extend automated findings
4. **Phase 4**: Combine results for comprehensive client reporting

**Real-World Application Discussion:**

- **Time-Limited Engagements**: When clients have budget constraints, automated tools maximize coverage
- **High-Value Targets**: Critical applications deserve both automated and manual testing
- **Compliance Testing**: Many regulations require human validation of automated findings
- **Custom Applications**: Manual testing is essential for business-specific vulnerabilities

### Phase 5: Professional Reporting (60 minutes) - UPDATED SECTION

#### Learning Focus

Emphasize understanding impact rather than causing damage:

- What data could an attacker access?
- How could they maintain persistence?
- What would be the business impact?
- How could detection be evaded?

#### Instructor Guidance

```bash
# Show persistence simulation
python samples/backdoor-apps/backdoor_app.py &
python src/analyzer/network_cli.py --monitor-connections --duration 60 --educational

# Discuss detection methods
# Analyze communication patterns
```
