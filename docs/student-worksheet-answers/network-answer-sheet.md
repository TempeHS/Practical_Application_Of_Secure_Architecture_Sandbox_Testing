### 2.1 Normal Traffic Baseline

**Expected Command**: `python samples/network-scenarios/basic_network_activity.py &`
**Expected Command**: `python src/analyzer/network_cli.py --monitor --duration 60`

**Typical Baseline Characteristics**:
- **Protocols Observed**: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), DNS (53), SSH (22)
- **Connection Patterns**: Regular outbound connections, periodic DNS queries
- **Data Volumes**: Moderate, consistent traffic patterns
- **Geographic Distribution**: Expected organizational/ISP ranges

**Normal Activity Indicators**:

**Normal vs Suspicious Indicators**:

| Aspect | Normal Baseline | Suspicious Pattern |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Connection Frequency** | **Steady, predictable** | **Sudden bursts or unusual timing** |
| **Destination Diversity** | **Limited, known services** | **Many random destinations** |
| **Protocol Usage** | **Standard web/business** | **Unusual protocols or ports** |
