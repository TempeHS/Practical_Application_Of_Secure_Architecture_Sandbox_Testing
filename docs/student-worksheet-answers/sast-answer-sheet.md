## üìã Exercise 1: SAST Fundamentals - Answer Key

### 1.1 Tool Availability Check

**Expected Output**:
```
Available tools: ['bandit', 'semgrep', 'safety']
```

**Teaching Note**: If tools are missing, guide students through installation or container restart.

### 1.2 Basic Command Understanding

| Command Flag | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| `--educational` | **Provides detailed explanations and learning context for findings** |
| `--verbose` | **Shows detailed output including tool execution details and debug information** |
| `--output json` | **Formats output as JSON for structured data processing and automation** |

### 1.3 Reflection Questions

**1. What is the main difference between SAST and DAST?**
**Expected Answer**: 
- SAST analyzes source code without executing the program (white-box testing)
- DAST tests running applications by sending inputs and analyzing responses (black-box testing)
- SAST finds code-level vulnerabilities; DAST finds runtime vulnerabilities
- SAST is faster and can analyze all code paths; DAST requires running application

**2. When in the development process should SAST be performed?**
**Expected Answer**: 
- Early in development cycle (during coding phase)
- As part of continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
- Before code commits or merges
- During code reviews
- Before application deployment

**3. What are two limitations of SAST tools?**
**Expected Answers**:
a) **False positives** - May flag secure code as vulnerable
b) **Context limitations** - Cannot understand runtime behavior or data flow
c) **Configuration issues** - May miss vulnerabilities in configuration files
d) **Language coverage** - Limited to supported programming languages

## üìã Exercise 2: Flask Application Analysis - Answer Key

### 2.1 Initial Analysis Results

**Expected Command**: `python src/analyzer/analyze_cli.py samples/vulnerable-flask-app --educational`

**Typical Findings Summary** (17-20 findings expected):
- **Total Findings**: 17-20 security issues
- **High Severity**: 7-9 issues (SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, XSS)
- **Medium Severity**: 8-12 issues (security headers, input validation)
- **Low Severity**: 2-4 issues (code quality, minor security practices)

**Key Vulnerabilities Students Should Identify**:
1. **SQL Injection** (High) - Direct SQL query construction
2. **Cross-Site Scripting** (High) - Unescaped user input in templates
3. **Hardcoded Secrets** (High) - Database credentials in source code
4. **Debug Mode** (Medium) - Flask debug mode enabled
5. **Missing Security Headers** (Medium) - No CSRF protection, security headers

### 2.2 Vulnerability Deep Dive

**SQL Injection Analysis**:
- **Location**: Login functionality, search features
- **Evidence**: String concatenation in SQL queries like `"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='" + username + "'"`
- **Risk**: Database compromise, data theft, authentication bypass

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
- **Location**: Comment sections, search results, user profile pages
- **Evidence**: Direct template rendering without escaping: `{{ user_input }}`
- **Risk**: Account hijacking, malicious script execution, data theft

**Hardcoded Secrets**:
- **Location**: Configuration files, database connection strings
- **Evidence**: `DATABASE_URL = "mysql://admin:password123@localhost"`
- **Risk**: Credential exposure, unauthorized access, system compromise

### 2.3 Remediation Planning

**Prioritization Strategy** (High to Low):
1. **SQL Injection** - Immediate fix required (parameterized queries)
2. **Hardcoded Secrets** - Critical for production (environment variables)
3. **XSS** - Important for user safety (template escaping)
4. **Debug Mode** - Security best practice (disable in production)
5. **Security Headers** - Defense in depth (implement CSP, CSRF protection)
