## üìö Key Concepts

### What is Organizational Vulnerability Assessment?

**Organizational vulnerability assessment** evaluates the people, processes, and
technology practices that contribute to an organization's overall security
posture. It identifies systemic security weaknesses in how security is managed,
implemented, and maintained.

### Why Organizational Assessment Matters

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Addresses systemic issues, not just symptoms
- **Sustainable Security**: Creates lasting security improvements
- **Business Alignment**: Aligns security with business objectives
- **Cultural Development**: Builds security-aware organizational culture
- **Compliance Requirements**: Many standards require organizational controls
