# Navigate to analysis workspace
cd /sandbox/analysis

# Check available monitoring tools
which strace netstat top lsof
```

### File Analysis Commands

```bash
# Analyse suspicious script safely
python src/analyser/sandbox_cli.py samples/suspicious-scripts/fake_game.py

# Monitor system calls during execution
strace -o trace.log python suspicious_file.py

# Check network connections
netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN

# Monitor resource usage
top -p $(pgrep python)
```

### Application Testing Commands

```bash
# Test web application in isolation
python src/analyser/sandbox_cli.py samples/unsecure-pwa/

# Monitor file system access
lsof -p $(pgrep python) | grep -E "(REG|DIR)"

# Check for unauthorized network activity
ss -tuln | grep -v "127.0.0.1"
```

### Report Generation

```bash
# Generate sandbox analysis report
python src/analyser/sandbox_cli.py target_file --report

# Save findings to file
python src/analyser/sandbox_cli.py target_file > reports/sandbox_report_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
## Concepts

### Sandbox Security Principles

**Application Isolation**: Containers provide secure boundaries for analysing untrusted code
- Applications run in controlled environment
- Cannot access host system resources
- Network activity is monitored and contained

**Behavioural Analysis**: Monitor application actions to detect threats
- System call tracing reveals file access patterns
- Network monitoring shows communication attempts
- Resource tracking identifies abuse attempts

**Threat Detection**: Identify malicious behaviour through observation
- Unauthorized file access attempts
- Suspicious network connections
- Abnormal resource consumption patterns

### Security by Design Implementation

**Safe Execution Environment**: Multi-layer isolation protects analysis infrastructure
- Docker containers provide process isolation
- Network segmentation prevents lateral movement
- Resource limits prevent denial of service

**Defensive Programming**: Monitor inputs and outputs for validation
- Track all file system interactions
- Log network communication attempts
- Monitor memory and CPU usage patterns

### Analysis Methodology

**Static Behavioural Prediction**: Examine code for potential threats before execution
**Dynamic Behavioural Monitoring**: Observe actual behaviour during controlled execution
**Post-Execution Analysis**: Review logs and traces for security implications

## Issues

### Common Analysis Problems

**Container Access Issues**:
```bash
# Fix: Ensure Docker services are running
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
docker exec -it cybersec_sandbox bash
```

**Monitoring Tool Failures**:
```bash
# Fix: Check tool availability and permissions
which strace netstat lsof || echo "Tools missing - check container setup"
```

**Network Connectivity Problems**:
```bash
# Fix: Verify container network configuration
docker network ls | grep sandbox
ping 172.20.0.3  # Test target connectivity
```

### Analysis Interpretation Issues

**Too Much Output**: Use filters to focus on relevant data
- `strace -e trace=openat` for file access only
- `netstat | grep ESTABLISHED` for active connections only

**Missing Context**: Add timestamps and process information
- `strace -t` for chronological analysis
- `lsof -p PID` for process-specific monitoring

**False Positives**: Normal application behaviour vs. threats
- Compare with baseline behaviour
- Focus on unexpected or unauthorized actions
- Consider legitimate application functions

### File System Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor file access in real-time
inotifywait -m -r --format '%w%f %e' /tmp

# Monitor specific events
inotifywait -m -e create,modify,delete /tmp

# Find recently created files
find /tmp -type f -newermt "5 minutes ago"
```

## üîç Analysis Patterns

### System Call Analysis

```bash
# File operations
grep -E "(openat|read|write)" trace.log

# Network operations
grep -E "(socket|connect|bind)" trace.log

# Process operations
grep -E "(execve|fork|clone)" trace.log

# Specific file access
grep "/etc/passwd" trace.log
grep "/home" trace.log
```

### Network Analysis

```bash
# Before/after network comparison
netstat -tupln > before.log
# ... run suspicious application ...
netstat -tupln > after.log
diff before.log after.log

# Find listening services
netstat -tupln | grep LISTEN

# Find external connections
netstat -tupln | grep -v "127.0.0.1\|::1"
```

### Web Application Testing

```bash
# Basic endpoint testing
curl http://localhost:5000/
curl http://localhost:5000/admin
curl http://localhost:5000/debug

# Directory enumeration
dirb http://localhost:5000/ /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt

# Common backdoor paths
curl http://localhost:5000/shell
curl http://localhost:5000/cmd
curl http://localhost:5000/backdoor

# Command execution testing
curl "http://localhost:5000/backdoor?cmd=whoami"
curl "http://localhost:5000/admin?cmd=ls%20-la"
```

## üö® Malicious Behaviour Indicators

### File System Indicators

- Access to sensitive files (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`)
- Creation of hidden files (starting with `.`)
- Writing to system directories (`/tmp`, `/var/tmp`)
- Modifying configuration files

### Network Indicators

- Connections to unusual ports (4444, 6666, 8080)
- Connections to suspicious domains
- Outbound connections on common malware ports
- Data exfiltration patterns

### Process Indicators

- High CPU usage (>80% sustained)
- Multiple threads/processes
- Unusual process names
- Hidden or obfuscated processes

### Resource Abuse Indicators

- Sustained high CPU/memory usage
- Network connections to mining pools
- Unusual disk I/O patterns
- Process persistence mechanisms

## üõ°Ô∏è Common Malware Types

### Information Stealers

**Behaviour**: Access sensitive files, capture credentials **Indicators**:

- Reading `/etc/passwd`, browser files
- Network connections to C&C servers
- File exfiltration patterns

### Backdoors/RATs

**Behaviour**: Provide remote access to attackers **Indicators**:

- Listening on unusual ports
- Command execution capabilities
- Hidden web interfaces

### Cryptocurrency Miners

**Behaviour**: Use system resources for mining **Indicators**:

- High CPU usage across multiple cores
- Connections to mining pools

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

```bash
# Permission denied errors
sudo chmod +x script.py

# Container not accessible
docker-compose restart cybersec_sandbox

# Too much trace output
strace -e trace=file python script.py

# Process not found
ps aux | grep python
```

### Log Analysis Tips

```bash
# Count specific events
grep -c "openat" trace.log

# Show unique file accesses
grep "openat" trace.log | cut -d'"' -f2 | sort -u

# Filter by return codes
grep "= -1" trace.log  # Failed system calls
grep "= 0" trace.log   # Successful calls
```

## üìä Quick Risk Assessment

### Severity Levels

- **CRITICAL**: Remote code execution, system compromise
- **HIGH**: Data theft, privilege escalation
- **MEDIUM**: Information disclosure, resource abuse
- **LOW**: Minor configuration issues

### Evidence Quality

- **STRONG**: Multiple indicators, clear malicious intent
- **MODERATE**: Some suspicious behaviour, needs investigation
- **WEAK**: Minimal indicators, might be false positive

## ÔøΩÔ∏è Safety Reminders (Security by Design Principles)

### Professional Security Testing Standards

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never** run suspicious code outside containerized sandbox environments
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Always** use isolated environments for **safe execution of untrusted
  code**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Verify** container isolation before testing malicious applications
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Document** everything for evidence and **incident response** procedures
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Report** confirmed threats following proper **disclosure protocols**

**Educational Value**: These practices mirror professional **security management
strategies** used in:

- **Malware analysis laboratories** (corporate security teams)
- **Incident response investigations** (forensics and containment)
- **Security research facilities** (vulnerability discovery)
- **Penetration testing engagements** (ethical hacking assessments)

### Container Security Verification

```bash
# Verify container isolation boundaries
docker inspect cybersec_sandbox | grep -A5 SecurityOpt

# Check resource limitations are active
docker stats cybersec_sandbox --no-stream

# Confirm network segmentation
docker network inspect docker_sandbox_network
```

**Why This Matters**: Container verification ensures our **application isolation
and containment** is functioning properly, providing the **safe execution
environment** necessary for analysing potentially dangerous software.

### Emergency Commands (Incident Response Procedures)

```bash
# Kill runaway processes (containment)
pkill -f suspicious_script.py

# Reset sandbox environment (clean slate)
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d

# Check container isolation (security verification)
docker inspect cybersec_sandbox | grep -A5 SecurityOpt
```

**Professional Connection**: These emergency procedures mirror real-world
**incident response and containment** protocols used when security threats are
detected in production environments.
