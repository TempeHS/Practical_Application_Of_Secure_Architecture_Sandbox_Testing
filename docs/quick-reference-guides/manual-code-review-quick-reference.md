## üéØ Purpose

This quick reference provides students with essential concepts, methodologies,
and checklists for conducting effective manual security code reviews.

## üìö Key Concepts

### What is Manual Code Review?

**Manual code review** is the systematic examination of source code by human
reviewers to identify security vulnerabilities, logic flaws, and coding best
practice violations using human intelligence and context understanding.

### Why Manual Review Matters

- **Business Logic Flaws**: Only humans understand intended vs actual behavior
- **Complex Attack Chains**: Human reviewers can trace multi-step scenarios
- **Context Awareness**: Understanding application purpose and data sensitivity
- **False Positive Reduction**: Human judgment eliminates tool noise

## üîç Manual vs Automated Testing

| Aspect              | Manual Code Review            | Automated SAST/DAST          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Detection**       | Complex logic, business flaws | Known vulnerability patterns |
| **False Positives** | Low (human judgment)          | High (pattern matching)      |
| **Speed**           | Slower, thorough              | Fast, repeatable             |
| **Context**         | Excellent understanding       | Limited context              |
| **Expertise**       | High security knowledge       | Basic tool operation         |

## üìã Systematic Review Methodology

### 1. Application Understanding

- [ ] **Map application architecture** - Understand components and data flow
- [ ] **Identify entry points** - Forms, APIs, file uploads, URL parameters
- [ ] **Trace data flow** - Follow user input through the application
- [ ] **Understand business logic** - What is the application supposed to do?

### 2. Security Focus Areas

- [ ] **Authentication & Session Management**
- [ ] **Input Validation & Sanitization**
- [ ] **Output Encoding & XSS Prevention**
- [ ] **SQL Injection Prevention**
- [ ] **Authorization & Access Control**
- [ ] **Error Handling & Information Disclosure**
- [ ] **Configuration Security**

### 3. Code Analysis Process

- [ ] **Read systematically** - Don't skip around randomly
- [ ] **Question assumptions** - "What if this input is malicious?"
- [ ] **Think like an attacker** - "How could I misuse this?"
- [ ] **Consider edge cases** - What happens when things go wrong?

## üö® Common Vulnerability Patterns

### SQL Injection üî¥ CRITICAL

**Vulnerable Pattern:**

```python
cur.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '{user_id}'")
```

**Secure Pattern:**

```python
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", (user_id,))
```

**Look For:** String formatting/concatenation in SQL queries

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) üü† HIGH

**Vulnerable Pattern:**

```html
<div>{{ user_input|safe }}</div>
```

**Secure Pattern:**

```html
<div>{{ user_input }}</div>
```

**Look For:** `|safe` filters, direct HTML writing, unescaped output

### Authentication Bypass üü† HIGH

**Vulnerable Pattern:**

```python
# Checking username and password separately
check_username(user)
check_password(pass)
```

**Secure Pattern:**

```python
# Checking both together
check_credentials(user, pass)
```

**Look For:** Separate validation logic, logic gaps

### Hard-coded Secrets üü° MEDIUM

**Vulnerable Pattern:**

```python
SECRET_KEY = "hardcoded_secret_123"
```

**Secure Pattern:**

```python
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
```

**Look For:** Passwords, API keys, tokens in source code

## ‚úÖ Security Review Checklist

### Authentication Review

- [ ] Are passwords stored securely (hashed, not plain text)?
- [ ] Is password complexity enforced?
- [ ] Are there brute force protections?
- [ ] Is session management secure?
- [ ] Are authentication bypass scenarios possible?

### Input Validation Review

- [ ] Is all user input validated before processing?
- [ ] Are file uploads restricted and validated?
- [ ] Is input length/format/type checking implemented?
- [ ] Are special characters handled safely?
- [ ] Is input sanitized before database operations?

### SQL Injection Review

- [ ] Are parameterized queries used for all database operations?
- [ ] Is dynamic SQL query construction avoided?
- [ ] Are stored procedures used securely?
- [ ] Is user input properly escaped before database queries?

### XSS Prevention Review

- [ ] Is user output properly encoded in templates?
- [ ] Are `|safe` filters avoided or justified?
- [ ] Is user-generated content sanitized before display?
- [ ] Are Content Security Policy headers implemented?

### Authorization Review

- [ ] Are sensitive functions protected with access controls?
- [ ] Is user authorization checked on every privileged operation?
- [ ] Can users access data/functions they shouldn't?
- [ ] Are administrative functions properly protected?

### Error Handling Review

- [ ] Are detailed error messages hidden from users?
- [ ] Is sensitive information excluded from logs?
- [ ] Are database errors handled gracefully?
- [ ] Is debug mode disabled in production?

## üìä Risk Assessment Framework

### Severity Levels

**üî¥ CRITICAL**

- Direct system compromise
- Complete data access
- Administrative privilege escalation
- _Examples: SQL injection, authentication bypass_

**üü† HIGH**

- Significant security impact
- User data compromise
- Cross-user access
- _Examples: XSS, authorization flaws_

**üü° MEDIUM**

- Moderate security impact
- Limited data exposure
- Requires specific conditions
- _Examples: information disclosure, weak crypto_

**üü¢ LOW**

- Minor security concerns
- Limited impact
- Difficult to exploit
- _Examples: minor info leaks, configuration issues_

### Impact Assessment Questions

1. **What data could be accessed?** (Confidentiality)
2. **What data could be modified?** (Integrity)
3. **What services could be disrupted?** (Availability)
4. **How many users would be affected?**
5. **How difficult is exploitation?**

## üîß Review Tips and Best Practices

### Effective Review Strategies

1. **Start with entry points** - Forms, URL parameters, file uploads
2. **Follow the data** - Trace user input through the application
3. **Focus on trust boundaries** - Where does untrusted data cross into trusted
   operations?
4. **Look for patterns** - Similar code often has similar vulnerabilities
5. **Consider the attacker mindset** - What would you target?

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Don't rush** - Thorough analysis takes time
- **Don't assume** - Question everything, even "safe" operations
- **Don't ignore context** - Understanding business logic is crucial
- **Don't skip documentation** - Record everything you find

### Time Management

- **Set specific time limits** for each review area
- **Take breaks** to maintain focus and fresh perspective
- **Review systematically** rather than jumping around
- **Document as you go** to avoid losing findings
