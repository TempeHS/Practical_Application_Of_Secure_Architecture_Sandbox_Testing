## ÔøΩ Pre-Exercise Setup Verification

**Before starting the DAST analysis, verify your environment is ready:**

### Step 1: Check Docker Containers

```bash
# Command to run:
cd docker && docker-compose ps
```

**Expected Output**: You should see containers running including
`cybersec_sandbox` and `vulnerable_web_app`

**Container Status Check:**

- [ ] `cybersec_sandbox` - State: Up
- [ ] `vulnerable_web_app` - State: Up

### Step 2: Verify Applications Are Accessible

```bash
# Test Flask Application (Port 5000):
curl -s http://localhost:5000 | head -3

# Test PWA Application (Port 9090):
curl -s http://localhost:9090 | head -3
```

**Application Accessibility Check:**

- [ ] Flask App responds at http://localhost:5000 ‚úÖ
- [ ] PWA App responds at http://localhost:9090 ‚úÖ

### Step 3: Test DAST Tool

```bash
# Verify DAST analyzer is working:
python src/analyzer/dast_cli.py --help
```

**Tool Verification:**

- [ ] DAST CLI displays help information ‚úÖ

### Troubleshooting:

**If applications don't respond:**

1. Restart containers:
   `cd docker && docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`
2. Wait 30 seconds for applications to fully start
3. Re-test with curl commands above

**If you encounter any issues, notify your instructor before proceeding.**
