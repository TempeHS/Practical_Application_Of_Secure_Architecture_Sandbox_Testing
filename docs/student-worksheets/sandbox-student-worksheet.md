## üîß Pre-Exercise Setup Verification

**Before starting sandbox analysis, verify your environment is ready:**

### Step 1: Check Docker Environment

```bash
# Verify containers are running:
cd docker && docker-compose ps
```

**Container Status Check:**

- [ ] `cybersec_sandbox` - State: Up
- [ ] `vulnerable_web_app` - State: Up

### Step 2: Test Sandbox Tools

```bash
# Test system monitoring tools:
strace --version
netstat --version
htop --version
```

**Sandbox Tools Check:**

- [ ] System call tracing (strace) available ‚úÖ
- [ ] Network monitoring (netstat) available ‚úÖ
- [ ] Resource monitoring (htop) available ‚úÖ

### Step 3: Verify Sample Applications

```bash
# Check suspicious applications:
ls samples/suspicious-scripts/
ls samples/backdoor-apps/
ls samples/resource-abuse/
```

**Sample Applications Check:**

- [ ] Suspicious scripts accessible ‚úÖ
- [ ] Backdoor applications accessible ‚úÖ
- [ ] Resource abuse samples accessible ‚úÖ

### Step 4: Test Container Access

```bash
# Enter sandbox environment:
docker exec -it cybersec_sandbox bash
```

**Container Access Check:**

- [ ] Successfully entered sandbox environment ‚úÖ
- [ ] Can navigate to /workspace directory ‚úÖ

### Troubleshooting:

**If any verification fails:**

1. Restart containers:
   `cd docker && docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`
2. Wait 30 seconds for services to initialize
3. Re-run verification commands
4. **Notify instructor if sandbox environment doesn't work properly**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Complete ALL verification steps before proceeding with sandbox analysis
exercises.**
