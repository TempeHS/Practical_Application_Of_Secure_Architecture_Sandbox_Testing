## Activities

### Activity 1: Environment Verification and Basic Scanning

**Check Docker containers are running:**
```bash
cd docker && docker-compose ps
```

**Test application accessibility:**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5000 | head -3  # PWA app (primary)
curl -s http://localhost:9090 | head -3  # Flask app (secondary)
```

**Run PWA application quick scan:**
```bash
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:5000 --quick --educational
```

**Record scan results:**
- Total findings: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
- Critical/High/Medium/Low: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
- Scan duration: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### Activity 2: Deep Scan and PWA Analysis

**Run deep scan on PWA application:**
```bash
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:5000 --deep-scan --educational
```

**Run secondary Flask application scan:**
```bash
python src/analyser/dast_cli.py http://localhost:9090 --educational --output flask_report.json
```

**Compare results between quick and deep scans:**
- Additional endpoints found: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
- New vulnerabilities detected: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
