## üîß Pre-Exercise Setup Verification

**Before starting network analysis, verify your environment is ready:**

### Step 1: Check Docker Environment

```bash
# Verify containers are running:
cd docker && docker-compose ps
```

**Container Status Check:**

- [ ] `cybersec_sandbox` - State: Up
- [ ] `vulnerable_web_app` - State: Up

### Step 2: Test Network Analysis Tools

```bash
# Test Network Analysis CLI:
python src/analyzer/network_cli.py --help

# Test basic network tools:
nmap --version
netstat --version
```

**Network Tools Check:**

- [ ] Network Analysis CLI available ‚úÖ
- [ ] Nmap available ‚úÖ
- [ ] Netstat available ‚úÖ

### Step 3: Verify Network Scenarios

```bash
# Check sample network scenarios:
ls samples/network-scenarios/
python samples/network-scenarios/basic_network_activity.py --help
```

**Network Scenarios Check:**

- [ ] Network scenario scripts accessible ‚úÖ
- [ ] Basic network activity script executable ‚úÖ

### Step 4: Test Target Applications (Network Monitoring Targets)

```bash
# Test network monitoring targets:
curl -s http://localhost:5000 | head -2
curl -s http://localhost:9090 | head -2
```

**Monitoring Targets Check:**

- [ ] Flask App accessible for monitoring ‚úÖ
- [ ] PWA App accessible for monitoring ‚úÖ

### Step 5: Basic Network Connectivity Test

```bash
# Test basic network monitoring:
python src/analyzer/network_cli.py --monitor-connections --duration 10
```

**Network Monitoring Test:**

- [ ] Network monitoring produces output ‚úÖ
- [ ] No connection errors ‚úÖ

### Troubleshooting:

**If any verification fails:**

1. Restart containers:
   `cd docker && docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`
2. Wait 30 seconds for network services to initialize
3. Re-run verification commands
4. **Notify instructor if network tools don't work - networking issues require
   administrator assistance**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Complete ALL verification steps before proceeding with network analysis
exercises.**
