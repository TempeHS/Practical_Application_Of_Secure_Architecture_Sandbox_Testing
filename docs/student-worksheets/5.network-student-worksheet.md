   ```bash
   Commands to run:
   - nslookup google.com
   - nslookup github.com
   - dig stackoverflow.com
   ```

### DNS Analysis Results

**DNS Query Patterns**: Record your DNS analysis results:

| Domain Queried | Query Type                   | Response Time              | Suspicious (Y/N) | Reason   |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| **\_\_\_\_**   | **\_\_\_\_****\*\*\_\_**\*\* | **\_\_\_\_**\_**\_\_\_\_** | **\_\_\_\_**     | **\_\_** |
| **\_\_\_\_**   | **\_\_\_\_****\*\*\_\_**\*\* | **\_\_\_\_**\_**\_\_\_\_** | **\_\_\_\_**     | **\_\_** |
| **\_\_\_\_**   | **\_\_\_\_****\*\*\_\_**\*\* | **\_\_\_\_**\_**\_\_\_\_** | **\_\_\_\_**     | **\_\_** |
| **\_\_\_\_**   | **\_\_\_\_****\*\*\_\_**\*\* | **\_\_\_\_**\_**\_\_\_\_** | **\_\_\_\_**     | **\_\_** |

**Suspicious DNS Indicators**: Look for these patterns and check if you found
any:

- [ ] Unusually long subdomain names (potential DNS tunneling)
- [ ] Queries to suspicious top-level domains (.tk, .ml, etc.)
- [ ] High frequency of queries to the same domain
- [ ] Failed DNS resolutions to suspicious domains
