- **Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment** - Combining automated tools with manual analysis for comprehensive coverage (like professional security auditing)
- **Phase 3A: Automated Penetration Testing** - Using professional-grade automated tools for efficient comprehensive testing (like security scanning appliances)
- **Phase 3B: Manual Exploitation** - Controlled manual exploitation of specific vulnerabilities for detailed analysis (like targeted security testing)
- **Phase 4: Post-Exploitation** - Understanding impact and maintaining access using both automated and manual techniques (like understanding full security implications)
