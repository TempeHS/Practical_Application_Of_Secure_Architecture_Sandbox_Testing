# Sandbox Security Analysis Exercise

## 📖 Overview

Sandbox security analysis involves testing applications in isolated, controlled
environments to detect malicious behavior, system vulnerabilities, and security
weaknesses. Unlike SAST (which analyzes code) and DAST (which tests running
applications), sandbox analysis observes how applications behave when executed
in a secure environment.

**Think of it this way:** If SAST is like reading a recipe to check for
dangerous ingredients, and DAST is like taste-testing a finished meal, then
sandbox analysis is like watching someone cook in a separate kitchen while you
observe everything they do through a window.

**Key Learning Objectives:**

- ✅ Understand what sandbox security analysis is and why it's critical
- ✅ Learn how to execute applications safely in controlled environments
- ✅ Practice monitoring system calls, network activity, and resource usage
- ✅ Identify potentially malicious behavior patterns
- ✅ Analyze sandbox logs to detect security threats
- ✅ Generate comprehensive sandbox analysis reports

## 📍 Getting Started - Important Navigation

**🏠 Always start from the main project folder:**

```bash
# If you get lost, return to the main folder:
cd /workspaces/Docker_Sandbox_Demo

# Check you're in the right place:
ls
```

**Expected Output:**

```
copilot-instructions.md  docker/  docs/  reports/  samples/  src/  ...
```

- **Tools missing?** This is normal - focus on the Python analysis tools

### 🔧 Analysis Tools (What Each One Does)

**System Call Monitoring:**

- **strace**: Records every system call an application makes (like keeping a
  diary of everything it does)

**Network Monitoring:**

- **netstat**: Shows current network connections (like seeing who's talking to
  whom)
- **tcpdump**: Captures network traffic (like recording phone conversations)

**Process Monitoring:**

- **ps**: Shows running processes (like seeing who's currently working)
- **top**: Shows resource usage (like monitoring how much work everyone is
  doing)

**File System Monitoring:**

- **inotifywait**: Watches for file changes (like security cameras for files)
- **lsof**: Shows what files are open (like seeing what documents people are
  reading)

## 🎯 Sample Applications for Analysis

### 1. Suspicious Python Script (`suspicious_script.py`)

- **Technology**: Python with potential malicious behavior
- **Location**: `samples/suspicious-scripts/suspicious_script.py`
- **Behaviors to Monitor**: File access, network connections, system calls
- **Expected Findings**: Unauthorized file access, suspicious network activity

### 2. Web Application with Backdoor (`backdoor_app.py`)

- **Technology**: Flask web application with hidden functionality
- **Location**: `samples/backdoor-apps/backdoor_app.py`
- **Behaviors to Monitor**: Hidden endpoints, file uploads, command execution
- **Expected Findings**: Command injection, file system manipulation

### 3. Cryptocurrency Mining Script (`crypto_miner.py`)

- **Technology**: Python script that uses excessive CPU resources
- **Location**: `samples/resource-abuse/crypto_miner.py`
- **Behaviors to Monitor**: CPU usage, network connections to mining pools
- **Expected Findings**: High resource consumption, suspicious network traffic

## 🔍 Analysis Techniques

### 1. System Call Monitoring

Monitor how applications interact with the operating system:

```bash
# Trace system calls for a Python script
strace -o trace.log python suspicious_script.py

# Analyze the trace for suspicious patterns
grep -E "(open|write|connect|execve)" trace.log
```

### 2. Network Traffic Analysis

Monitor network connections and data transmission:

```bash
# Monitor network connections
netstat -tupln

# Capture network traffic during execution
tcpdump -i any -w network_capture.pcap &
python suspicious_script.py
pkill tcpdump
```

### 3. File System Monitoring

Track file creation, modification, and access:

```bash
# Monitor file system changes
inotifywait -m -r --format '%w%f %e' /tmp &
python suspicious_script.py
```

### 4. Resource Usage Analysis

Monitor CPU, memory, and other resource consumption:

```bash
# Monitor resource usage
top -b -n 1 -p $(pgrep python)

# Track process tree
pstree -p $(pgrep python)
```

## 📋 Hands-On Exercise 1: Basic Sandbox Analysis

### 🎯 Goal: Analyze a suspicious Python script in a controlled environment to identify potential security threats

### Step 1: Prepare the Sandbox Environment

**Make sure you're in the sandbox container:**

```bash
# If you're not already in the container, enter it:
docker exec -it cybersec_sandbox bash

# Navigate to the analysis workspace
cd /sandbox/analysis
pwd
```

**Expected Output:**

```
/sandbox/analysis
```

**Create a workspace for this analysis:**

```bash
# Create folders for our analysis
mkdir -p suspicious_script_analysis
cd suspicious_script_analysis
```

### Step 2: Examine the Suspicious Script (Safely!)

**Look at the script WITHOUT executing it:**

```bash
cat ../samples/suspicious_script.py
```

**Expected Output (sample - will vary):**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import socket
import subprocess

# This script might contain:
# - Network connections
# - File operations
# - System commands
# - Potentially suspicious behavior
```

**What to look for (note these patterns):**

- **Network connections**: `socket.connect()`, `urllib.request`
- **File operations**: `open()`, `write()`, `os.remove()`
- **System commands**: `subprocess.call()`, `os.system()`
- **Obfuscated code**: Base64 encoding, strange variable names

**Document your observations:**

```bash
echo "=== STATIC ANALYSIS NOTES ===" > analysis_report.txt
echo "Suspicious patterns observed:" >> analysis_report.txt
echo "- Network connections: [YES/NO]" >> analysis_report.txt
echo "- File operations: [YES/NO]" >> analysis_report.txt
echo "- System commands: [YES/NO]" >> analysis_report.txt
echo "- Obfuscated code: [YES/NO]" >> analysis_report.txt
echo "" >> analysis_report.txt
```

### Step 3: Set Up Monitoring

**Start system call monitoring (this records everything the script does):**

```bash
# Start monitoring system calls
strace -o syscalls.log -f python ../samples/suspicious_script.py &
SCRIPT_PID=$!
echo "Script running with PID: $SCRIPT_PID"
```

**Start network monitoring:**

```bash
# Capture network state before the script runs
netstat -tupln > network_before.log
echo "Network state captured before execution"
```

**What this monitoring does:**

- **strace**: Records every system call (like keeping a detailed diary)
- **netstat**: Shows network connections (like taking a snapshot of phone calls)

### Step 4: Execute and Monitor (Safely in Sandbox)

**Let the script run for 30 seconds:**

```bash
echo "Letting script run for 30 seconds..."
sleep 30
```

**Capture final network state:**

```bash
netstat -tupln > network_after.log
echo "Network state captured after execution"
```

**Stop the script safely:**

```bash
kill $SCRIPT_PID 2>/dev/null || echo "Script already finished"
```

### Step 5: Analyze Results

**Analyze system calls (what the script actually did):**

```bash
echo "=== FILE OPERATIONS ===" >> analysis_report.txt
grep -E "(openat|write|read)" syscalls.log | head -10 >> analysis_report.txt

echo "=== NETWORK OPERATIONS ===" >> analysis_report.txt
grep -E "(socket|connect|bind)" syscalls.log | head -10 >> analysis_report.txt

echo "=== PROCESS OPERATIONS ===" >> analysis_report.txt
grep -E "(execve|fork|clone)" syscalls.log | head -10 >> analysis_report.txt
```

**Compare network states:**

```bash
echo "=== NEW NETWORK CONNECTIONS ===" >> analysis_report.txt
diff network_before.log network_after.log >> analysis_report.txt || echo "No network changes detected" >> analysis_report.txt
```

**View your complete analysis:**

```bash
cat analysis_report.txt
```

**Expected Output (sample):**

```
=== STATIC ANALYSIS NOTES ===
Suspicious patterns observed:
- Network connections: YES
- File operations: YES
- System commands: NO

**❌ Troubleshooting:**

- **Script won't run?** Check you're in the sandbox:
  `docker exec -it cybersec_sandbox bash`
- **Permission denied?** Make sure you're in `/sandbox/analysis` directory
- **No output in logs?** This might be normal - the script may be benign or
  well-behaved
- **strace not working?** Try just running the script normally and observing its
  behavior

## 📋 Hands-On Exercise 2: Web Application Backdoor Detection

### Objective

Analyze a web application that contains hidden backdoor functionality.

### Steps

#### Step 1: Start the Backdoor Application

```bash
# Start the suspicious web application
cd /sandbox/samples/backdoor-apps
python backdoor_app.py &
APP_PID=$!

# Wait for application to start
sleep 5
```

#### Step 2: Monitor Application Behavior

```bash
# Monitor file system access
inotifywait -m -r --format '%w%f %e' /tmp > file_monitor.log &
MONITOR_PID=$!

# Monitor network connections
netstat -tupln > network_initial.log
```

#### Step 3: Test Normal Functionality

```bash
# Test normal web endpoints
curl http://localhost:5000/
curl http://localhost:5000/about
curl http://localhost:5000/contact
```

#### Step 4: Search for Hidden Endpoints

```bash
# Use directory enumeration to find hidden paths
dirb http://localhost:5000/ /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt

# Test common backdoor paths
curl http://localhost:5000/admin
curl http://localhost:5000/shell
curl http://localhost:5000/cmd
curl http://localhost:5000/backdoor
```

#### Step 5: Analyze Backdoor Activity

```bash
# Test command execution (if backdoor found)
curl "http://localhost:5000/backdoor?cmd=whoami"
curl "http://localhost:5000/backdoor?cmd=ls%20-la"

# Check for file system changes
cat file_monitor.log

# Check for new network activity
netstat -tupln > network_final.log
diff network_initial.log network_final.log
```

#### Step 6: Clean Up

```bash
# Stop monitoring and application
kill $MONITOR_PID $APP_PID
```

### Expected Results

Students should discover:

- ✅ Hidden backdoor endpoints
- ✅ Command execution capabilities
- ✅ Unauthorized file system access
- ✅ Suspicious network behavior

## 📋 Hands-On Exercise 3: Resource Abuse Detection

### Objective

Identify applications that abuse system resources, such as cryptocurrency
miners.

### Steps

#### Step 1: Baseline Resource Usage

```bash
# Record initial system state
top -b -n 1 > baseline_resources.log
free -h > baseline_memory.log
```

#### Step 2: Execute Resource-Intensive Application

```bash
# Start the crypto mining simulation
cd /sandbox/samples/resource-abuse
python crypto_miner.py &
MINER_PID=$!
```

#### Step 3: Monitor Resource Consumption

```bash
# Monitor for 60 seconds
for i in {1..12}; do
    echo "=== Measurement $i ===" >> resource_monitor.log
    top -b -n 1 -p $MINER_PID >> resource_monitor.log
    sleep 5
done
```

#### Step 4: Monitor Network Activity

```bash
# Check for mining pool connections
netstat -tupln | grep $MINER_PID
lsof -p $MINER_PID | grep ESTABLISHED
```

#### Step 5: Analyze Resource Impact

```bash
# Compare resource usage
echo "=== BASELINE CPU USAGE ==="
head -15 baseline_resources.log

echo "=== CURRENT CPU USAGE ==="
top -b -n 1

# Stop the miner
kill $MINER_PID
```

### Expected Results

Students should identify:

- ✅ Abnormally high CPU usage (>80%)
- ✅ Suspicious network connections to external servers
- ✅ Long-running processes with unclear purpose
- ✅ Resource consumption patterns typical of miners
