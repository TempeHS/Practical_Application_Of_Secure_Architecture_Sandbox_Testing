## üìç Getting Started - Important Navigation

**üè† Always start from the main project folder:**

```bash
# If you get lost, return to the main folder with this command:
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment

# Check you're in the right place (should see folders like 'src', 'samples', 'docker'):
ls
```

**Expected Output:**

```
copilot-instructions.md  docker/  docs/  reports/  samples/  src/  ...
```

## üìö What is Manual Code Review?

### Definition

Manual code review is the systematic examination of source code by human
reviewers to identify security vulnerabilities, logic flaws, and coding best
practice violations. Unlike automated tools, manual review relies on **human
intelligence and context understanding** to identify complex security issues.

### üîç Real-World Analogy

Think of manual code review like a **detective examining evidence**. While
security scanners are like metal detectors that find obvious problems, human
reviewers are like experienced detectives who can:

- Understand the **context** and **intent** behind code
- Spot **subtle patterns** that indicate security problems
- Identify **business logic flaws** that tools miss
- Recognize **architectural security issues**

### Key Characteristics:

- **Human Intelligence**: Leverages critical thinking and experience
- **Context Awareness**: Understands business logic and application flow
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies subtle security anti-patterns
- **Deep Analysis**: Can trace complex data flows and security boundaries

### Manual Review vs Automated Testing:

| Aspect                    | Manual Code Review                         | Automated SAST/DAST          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Detection Capability**  | Complex logic flaws, business logic issues | Known vulnerability patterns |
| **False Positives**       | Low (human judgment)                       | High (pattern matching)      |
| **Coverage**              | Selective, focused                         | Comprehensive, systematic    |
| **Speed**                 | Slower, thorough                           | Fast, repeatable             |
| **Expertise Required**    | High security knowledge                    | Basic tool operation         |
| **Context Understanding** | Excellent                                  | Limited                      |

### Why Manual Review Matters:

- **Business Logic Vulnerabilities**: Only humans can understand intended vs
  actual behavior
- **Complex Attack Chains**: Human reviewers can trace multi-step attack
  scenarios
- **Architecture Assessment**: Evaluation of overall security design and
  patterns
- **False Positive Reduction**: Human judgment eliminates tool noise
- **Compliance Requirements**: Many security standards require human review

## üéØ Exercise Overview

In this exercise, you will conduct a comprehensive manual security code review
of the **Unsecure PWA (Progressive Web Application)**. This application contains
multiple security vulnerabilities that demonstrate common coding mistakes and
security anti-patterns.

### üèóÔ∏è Application Architecture

The Unsecure PWA consists of:

- **Backend**: Python Flask web application (`main.py`, `user_management.py`)
- **Frontend**: HTML templates with form handling (`templates/` directory)
- **Database**: SQLite database for user and feedback storage
- **Authentication**: Custom user login and registration system

### üîç Review Focus Areas

Your manual review will focus on:

1. **Authentication and Session Management**
2. **Input Validation and Sanitization**
3. **SQL Injection Prevention**
4. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection**
5. **Business Logic Security**
6. **Error Handling and Information Disclosure**
7. **Authorization and Access Control**

## üìã Part 1: Application Discovery and Setup

### Step 1.1: Navigate to the Application

```bash
# Navigate to the Unsecure PWA directory
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment/samples/unsecure-pwa

# List all files to understand the application structure
ls -la
```

**Expected files:**

- `main.py` - Main Flask application
- `user_management.py` - Database operations and user handling
- `templates/` - HTML frontend files
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `database_files/` - SQLite database storage

### Step 1.2: Examine Application Structure

```bash
# View the main application entry point
cat main.py

# Examine the user management module
cat user_management.py

# Look at the HTML templates
ls templates/
cat templates/index.html
cat templates/signup.html
```

### Step 1.3: Start the Application (Optional - for context)

```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the application
python main.py
```

**Note**: The application will run on `http://localhost:5000`. You can view it
in your browser to understand the user interface, but the focus of this exercise
is **code review, not runtime testing**.
