# Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Exercise - Instructor Guide

## üéØ Teaching Objectives

This exercise is designed to teach high school students fundamental cybersecurity concepts through hands-on static analysis of web applications. The exercise progresses from basic tool usage to advanced security analysis and remediation planning.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Requirements

- **Total Duration**: 3-4 hours (can be split across multiple sessions)
- **Session 1** (1.5 hours): Introduction and Basic Analysis (Exercises 1-2)
- **Session 2** (1.5-2 hours): PWA Analysis and Advanced Techniques (Exercises 3-4)
- **Session 3** (30-60 minutes): Remediation and Assessment (Exercise 5)

## üë• Class Size and Setup

- **Optimal Class Size**: 12-20 students
- **Setup**: Individual workstations with GitHub Codespaces access
- **Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of web applications, basic programming concepts

## üìã Pre-Class Preparation

### Technical Setup:
1. ‚úÖ Ensure all students have GitHub accounts
2. ‚úÖ Verify Codespaces access and Docker Sandbox Demo deployment
3. ‚úÖ Test all analysis commands work in the environment
4. ‚úÖ Prepare sample outputs for demonstration

### Materials Needed:
- Student exercise handouts
- Instructor demonstration setup
- Answer keys and sample outputs
- Assessment rubrics

## üéì Learning Progression

### Foundation Concepts (Session 1):
Students learn what SAST is and how it differs from other testing approaches. They begin with basic tool usage and interpretation of security findings.

### Application Analysis (Session 2):
Students dive deeper into specific vulnerability types across different application architectures, learning to correlate tool outputs with actual security risks.

### Advanced Techniques (Session 3):
Students learn remediation planning, comparative analysis, and begin thinking like security professionals about risk prioritization.

## üìö Exercise-by-Exercise Instructor Notes

### Exercise 1: SAST Fundamentals

#### Key Teaching Points:
- SAST vs DAST vs manual review
- When to use static analysis in SDLC
- Limitations of automated tools

#### Common Student Questions:
**Q**: "Why doesn't SAST find all vulnerabilities?"
**A**: Emphasize that SAST analyzes code patterns but can't understand business logic or runtime behavior. It's one tool in a comprehensive security strategy.

**Q**: "Are there false positives?"
**A**: Yes, and this is why security professionals need to validate findings. Use this to discuss the importance of human expertise in cybersecurity.

#### Expected Outputs:
Students should successfully run basic commands and understand the difference between output modes.

### Exercise 2: Flask Application Analysis

#### Key Teaching Points:
- SQL injection mechanics and prevention
- Authentication security best practices
- Configuration security importance

#### Demonstration Scripts:
```bash
# Show SQL injection in action
echo "Demonstrate with: samples/vulnerable-flask-app/app.py line 235"
echo "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'"
echo "Vulnerable input: admin'; DROP TABLE users; --"
```

#### Expected Findings (Answer Key):
- **Total Findings**: ~47 (17 high, 26 medium, 4 low)
- **Critical Issues**: SQL injection, debug mode, weak hashing
- **Most Common**: SQL injection variants

#### Teaching Moments:
- When students find SQL injection, explain the "Little Bobby Tables" XKCD
- Use real-world examples like the TalkTalk breach (2015)
- Emphasize the cascade effect of security vulnerabilities

### Exercise 3: PWA Application Analysis

#### Key Teaching Points:
- Mobile security considerations
- Progressive Web App specific risks
- Multi-file analysis complexity

#### Expected Findings (Answer Key):
- **Total Findings**: ~17 (7 high, 9 medium, 1 low)
- **Key Vulnerabilities**: Open redirects, SQL injection, Flask debug mode
- **PWA-Specific**: Service worker security, offline data handling

#### Discussion Points:
- How mobile apps differ from traditional web apps
- Offline security considerations
- Data storage in browser environments

### Exercise 4: Advanced SAST Techniques

#### Key Teaching Points:
- Automation and tooling integration
- Comparative security analysis
- JSON output for DevOps integration

#### Instructor Demonstration:
```bash
# Show how to compare applications systematically
for app in vulnerable-flask-app unsecure-pwa; do
    echo "=== $app ==="
    python src/analyzer/analyze_cli.py samples/$app --educational | grep "Total:"
done
```

#### Advanced Students:
- Challenge them to write custom Semgrep rules
- Discuss CI/CD integration strategies
- Explore other SAST tools (SonarQube, Checkmarx, etc.)

### Exercise 5: Remediation Planning

#### Key Teaching Points:
- Risk-based prioritization
- Business impact consideration
- Verification of fixes

#### Hands-On Remediation Example:
```python
# Show vulnerable code
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}'"

# Show secure fix
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (username,))
```

#### Assessment Criteria:
- Can students identify the highest priority vulnerabilities?
- Do they understand the business impact of security issues?
- Can they articulate clear remediation steps?
