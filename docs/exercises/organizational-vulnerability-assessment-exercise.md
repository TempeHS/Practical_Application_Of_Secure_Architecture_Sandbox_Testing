## üìç Getting Started - Important Context

**üè† This exercise uses the Unsecure PWA as a case study:**

```bash
# Navigate to the case study application
cd /workspaces/Docker_Sandbox_Demo/samples/unsecure-pwa

# Review the application structure
ls -la
```

**Expected Context:**

- You have completed technical security analysis (Code Review, SAST, DAST)
- You now focus on **organizational and strategic** security assessment
- This represents the **holistic security evaluation** phase

## üìö What is Organizational Vulnerability Assessment?

### Definition

Organizational vulnerability assessment evaluates the **people, processes, and
technology practices** that contribute to an organization's overall security
posture. While technical testing finds code vulnerabilities, organizational
assessment identifies **systemic security weaknesses** in how security is
managed, implemented, and maintained.

### üîç Real-World Analogy

Think of organizational vulnerability assessment like a **comprehensive health
check-up**. While individual tests (blood work, X-rays) find specific problems,
the overall health assessment looks at:

- **Lifestyle factors** (organizational culture and practices)
- **Prevention strategies** (security policies and training)
- **Healthcare system** (security tools and processes)
- **Long-term health planning** (security strategy and governance)

### Key Focus Areas:

- **Technology Stack Security**: Architecture, frameworks, dependencies
- **Development Practices**: Secure coding, testing, deployment
- **Organizational Policies**: Security governance, compliance, training
- **Risk Management**: Threat modeling, incident response, business continuity
- **Security Culture**: Awareness, accountability, continuous improvement

### Assessment Scope:

| Technical Assessment       | Organizational Assessment           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Code vulnerabilities**   | **Development process security**    |
| **Application flaws**      | **Security policy effectiveness**   |
| **Infrastructure issues**  | **Training and awareness programs** |
| **Configuration problems** | **Risk management maturity**        |

### Why Organizational Assessment Matters:

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Addresses systemic issues, not just symptoms
- **Sustainable Security**: Creates lasting security improvements
- **Compliance Requirements**: Many standards require organizational controls
- **Business Risk Management**: Aligns security with business objectives
- **Culture Development**: Builds security-aware organizational culture
