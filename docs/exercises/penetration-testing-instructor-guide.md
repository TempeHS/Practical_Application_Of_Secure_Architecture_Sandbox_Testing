## üìñ Detailed Lesson Plan

### Introduction and Ethics (30 minutes)

#### Opening Discussion Questions
1. "What is the difference between ethical hacking and malicious hacking?"
2. "Why do organizations hire penetration testers?"
3. "What legal protections do penetration testers need?"

#### Key Concepts to Cover
- **Penetration Testing Definition**: Authorized testing of systems to find vulnerabilities
- **Ethical Hacking Principles**: Permission, scope, documentation, responsibility, no harm
- **Legal Framework**: Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, local laws, organizational policies
- **Professional Standards**: Industry certifications, responsible disclosure, client relationships

#### Demonstration: Real-World Case Studies
Present 2-3 brief case studies showing:
- Successful penetration testing that improved security
- Legal consequences of unauthorized access
- Ethical dilemmas faced by security professionals

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance (45 minutes)

#### Instructor Demonstration (15 minutes)
```bash
# Show systematic information gathering
python src/analyzer/network_cli.py --scan-services localhost --educational

# Explain what each piece of information reveals
# Discuss how attackers use this information
```

#### Guided Student Activity (30 minutes)
Students work through reconnaissance section with instructor support:
- Monitor student progress using worksheet checkpoints
- Ensure students document findings systematically
- Address questions about tool usage and interpretation

#### Common Student Questions and Answers
**Q**: "Why does network scanning sometimes fail?"
**A**: Network tools may have permissions issues in containerized environments. Use the educational mode flags for simulated results.

**Q**: "How much information gathering is legal?"
**A**: Information that is publicly available (like web directories) is generally legal to gather, but always ensure you have permission for the specific target.

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment (60 minutes)

#### Instructor Demonstration (20 minutes)
```bash
# Show integration of multiple analysis methods
python src/analyzer/analyze_cli.py samples/vulnerable-flask-app --educational
python src/analyzer/dast_cli.py http://localhost:5000 --quick --educational

# Explain how findings complement each other
# Demonstrate vulnerability prioritization
```

#### Student Working Session (40 minutes)
- Students integrate SAST, DAST, Network, and Sandbox findings
- Instructor circulates to provide individual guidance
- Emphasize systematic documentation and risk assessment

#### Expected Student Challenges
1. **Information Overload**: Too many findings to prioritize
   - **Solution**: Teach CVSS scoring and business impact assessment
2. **Tool Integration**: Difficulty correlating findings across tools
   - **Solution**: Provide finding correlation worksheet template
3. **Risk Assessment**: Unclear how to assess exploitability
   - **Solution**: Use provided risk matrix examples

### Phase 3: Controlled Exploitation (90 minutes)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Safety Briefing (10 minutes)
Before any exploitation activities:
1. Remind students of ethical boundaries
2. Verify all targets are within sandbox scope
3. Explain that exploitation must be documented and controlled
4. Set up monitoring to ensure no unauthorized access attempts

#### Instructor-Led Exploitation Demo (30 minutes)
```bash
# Demonstrate safe SQL injection testing
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/login" \
  -d "username=admin' OR '1'='1&password=anything"

# Show XSS testing with safe payloads
curl "http://localhost:5000/search?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>"

# Explain each step and safety considerations
```

#### Guided Student Exploitation (50 minutes)
- Students attempt exploitation under close supervision
- Instructor approves each exploitation attempt before execution
- Continuous monitoring for scope violations
- Document all successful and failed attempts

#### Exploitation Safety Checklist

- [ ] Exploitation method reviewed and approved
- [ ] Student understands the impact and scope
- [ ] Documentation template provided for recording results
- [ ] Emergency procedures explained if something goes wrong

### Phase 4: Post-Exploitation Analysis (45 minutes)

#### Learning Focus
Emphasize understanding impact rather than causing damage:
- What data could an attacker access?
- How could they maintain persistence?
- What would be the business impact?
- How could detection be evaded?

#### Instructor Guidance
```bash
# Show persistence simulation
python samples/backdoor-apps/backdoor_app.py &
python src/analyzer/network_cli.py --monitor-connections --duration 60 --educational

# Discuss detection methods
# Analyze communication patterns
```
