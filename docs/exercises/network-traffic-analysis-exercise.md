# Network Traffic Analysis Exercise

## üìñ Overview

Network Traffic Analysis is a cybersecurity technique that monitors, captures, and analyzes network communications to detect security threats, unauthorized access, and malicious activities. Unlike SAST (which analyzes code), DAST (which tests applications), and Sandbox analysis (which monitors application behavior), network analysis focuses on communication patterns and data flows between systems.

**Think of it this way:** If your computer network is like a building, network traffic analysis is like being a security guard who watches all the doors and windows to see who comes in, who goes out, and what they're carrying.

**Key Learning Objectives:**
- ‚úÖ Understand what network traffic analysis is and its role in cybersecurity
- ‚úÖ Learn to monitor active network connections and identify suspicious activity
- ‚úÖ Practice using network scanning tools to discover services and vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Analyze network traffic patterns for signs of malicious behavior
- ‚úÖ Detect network-based attacks like port scanning, data exfiltration, and C&C communication
- ‚úÖ Generate comprehensive network security reports

## üìç Getting Started - Important Navigation

**ÔøΩ Always start from the main project folder:**
```bash
# If you get lost, return to the main folder:
cd /workspaces/Docker_Sandbox_Demo

# Check you're in the right place:
ls
```
**Expected Output:**
```
copilot-instructions.md  docker/  docs/  reports/  samples/  src/  ...
```

## üåê What is Network Traffic Analysis?

### Definition
Network Traffic Analysis involves monitoring, capturing, and analyzing network communications to understand data flows, detect security threats, and ensure network security compliance.

### üîç Real-World Analogy
Think of network traffic analysis like being a security guard at a busy building:
- **Monitoring entrances**: Watching who comes and goes (connections)
- **Checking IDs**: Verifying who people claim to be (authentication)
- **Noting suspicious behavior**: Someone trying every door (port scanning)
- **Tracking packages**: What people are carrying in and out (data transfer)
- **Spotting patterns**: Regular visitors vs. unusual activity

### Key Characteristics:
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Observes network activity as it happens
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies suspicious communication patterns
- **Protocol Analysis**: Understands different network protocols and their behaviors
- **Threat Detection**: Spots indicators of network-based attacks

### Why Network Analysis Matters:
- **Early Threat Detection**: Catches attacks as they traverse the network
- **Incident Response**: Provides crucial evidence during security incidents
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Ensures adherence to security policies
- **Performance Optimization**: Identifies network bottlenecks and issues

## üß™ Lab Environment Setup

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites Check

**Step 1: Navigate to main folder**
```bash
cd /workspaces/Docker_Sandbox_Demo
pwd
```
**Expected Output:**
```
/workspaces/Docker_Sandbox_Demo
```

**Step 2: Test the network analysis tool**
```bash
python src/analyzer/network_cli.py --help
```

## üìã Hands-On Exercise 1: Network Connection Monitoring

### üéØ Goal: Monitor active network connections to identify potentially suspicious communication patterns

### Step 1: Baseline Network State

**Make sure you're in the right place:**
```bash
cd /workspaces/Docker_Sandbox_Demo
pwd  # Should show /workspaces/Docker_Sandbox_Demo
```

**Record current network connections:**
```bash
python src/analyzer/network_cli.py --monitor-connections --educational
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üåê NETWORK CONNECTION MONITORING
üìÖ Timestamp: 2025-XX-XX XX:XX:XX
üéì Educational Mode: Enabled

ACTIVE CONNECTIONS:
üîç TCP Connections:
  localhost:5000 (Flask App) - Status: LISTENING
  localhost:9090 (PWA App) - Status: LISTENING
  localhost:22 (SSH) - Status: LISTENING

üìä Connection Summary:
  Total Active: 15 connections
  Listening Services: 3
  Outbound Connections: 2
  Suspicious Patterns: 0
```

**Also try the manual approach:**
```bash
netstat -tuln | head -20
```
**Expected Output:**
```
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State      
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5000          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:9090          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
```

**What this means:**
- **LISTEN**: Service waiting for connections (like a store that's open)
- **Port 22**: SSH (secure remote access)
- **Port 5000**: Our Flask application
- **Port 9090**: Our PWA application

### Step 2: Analyze Connection Patterns

**Run comprehensive connection analysis:**
```bash
python src/analyzer/network_cli.py --monitor-connections --educational --verbose
```

**Expected Additional Output:**
```
üîç DETAILED CONNECTION ANALYSIS:

NORMAL PATTERNS DETECTED:
‚úÖ Web server listening on standard ports
‚úÖ SSH service for remote administration
‚úÖ Local application services

SECURITY ASSESSMENT:
üîµ Low Risk: Standard service ports detected
‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Risk: Debug services may be running
üö® High Risk: No immediate threats detected

RECOMMENDATIONS:
üí° Monitor for connections to unusual ports (1337, 4444, 6666)
üí° Watch for excessive connections from single IPs
üí° Alert on connections to known malicious IPs
```

**Look for specific patterns:**
```bash
netstat -tuln | grep ":80\|:443\|:22\|:3389"
```

**What you're looking for:**
- **Port 80**: HTTP web traffic  
- **Port 443**: HTTPS secure web traffic
- **Port 22**: SSH (secure shell)
- **Port 3389**: Remote Desktop (potentially risky)

### Step 3: Identify Suspicious Activity

**Check for connections to unusual ports:**
```bash
netstat -tuln | grep -E ":4444|:6666|:1337|:31337"
```
**Expected Output:** 
```
(No output expected - these are malicious ports that shouldn't be in use)
```

**If you see output here, it could indicate:**
- **Port 4444**: Common backdoor/malware port
- **Port 6666**: Often used by malicious software
- **Port 1337/31337**: "Leet" ports used by hackers

**Look for excessive connections from single IPs:**
```bash
netstat -tuln | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```
**Expected Output:**
```
      5 127.0.0.1    (localhost - normal)
      2 0.0.0.0      (all interfaces - normal)
      1 192.168.1.10 (example internal IP)
```
