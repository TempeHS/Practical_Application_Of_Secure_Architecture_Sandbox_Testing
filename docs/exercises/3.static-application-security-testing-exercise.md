# Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Exercise

## üéØ Overview

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) analyses source code **without executing the programme** to identify security vulnerabilities. This exercise teaches you to **apply security features incorporated into software** by using automated tools to detect common security issues and learn remediation techniques.

**Syllabus Alignment:**
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Source code analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Input validation**: Data format and range verification detection
- **Defensive data input handling**: Identifying sanitization and validation gaps
- **Cryptography contribution to security by design**: Detecting weak encryption implementations
- **OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities**: Systematic identification of common web application security risks

**Real-World Application:** Professional development teams use SAST tools in their development pipeline to catch security issues early, reducing costs and improving code quality before deployment.

## ÔøΩ Prerequisites

**Required Knowledge:**
- Basic Python programming skills
- Understanding of web applications and forms
- Familiarity with command line operations
- Basic concepts of security vulnerabilities

**Technical Setup:**
```bash
# Navigate to main project folder
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment

# Verify SAST tools are available
python3 src/analyser/analyse_cli.py --help
```

**What is SAST?**
Think of SAST like a **spell-check for security** - it reads your code and finds potential security problems before they become real threats. Just like proofreading an essay, SAST examines code **without running it** to catch security mistakes.

**SAST vs Other Testing Types:**

| Testing Type | When | Access | Execution | Real-World Example |
|--------------|------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **SAST** | Development | Source Code | No | Proofreading an essay |
| **DAST** | Runtime | External Interface | Yes | Listening to a speech |
| **Manual Review** | Development | Source Code | No | Teacher reviewing work |

**Step 1: Navigate to the main folder**

```bash
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment
```

**Step 2: Verify you're in the right place**

```bash
pwd
```

**Expected Output:**

```
/workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment
```

**Step 3: Check sample applications exist**

```bash
ls samples/
```

**Expected Output:**

```
README.md  backdoor-apps/  network-scenarios/  resource-abuse/  suspicious-scripts/  unsecure-pwa/  vulnerable-flask-app/
```

**Step 4: Test the analysis tool**

```bash
python src/analyser/analyse_cli.py --help
```

**Expected Output (first few lines):**

```
usage: analyse_cli.py [-h] [--educational] [--verbose] [--output {text,json}] file_or_directory
Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool for educational purposes
```

**‚ùå If Something Goes Wrong:**

- **Can't find folders?** Run: `cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment`
- **Python error?** Make sure you're in the main project folder
- **Tool not found?** Check that you're in `/workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment`

## üéØ Sample Applications (Your Security Testing Targets)

### 1. **Unsecure PWA** (`samples/unsecure-pwa/`)

- **Technology**: Progressive Web App with Python backend (primary target)
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates modern web application security vulnerabilities
- **What you'll find**: SQL injection, XSS, weak authentication, debug mode
## üîß Step-by-Step Activities

### Activity 1: SAST Tool Familiarization

**Syllabus Focus:** **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** tool operation and configuration

**Step 1.1: Verify Tool Setup**
```bash
# Check you're in the correct location
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment
pwd

# Test the SAST analysis tool
python src/analyser/analyse_cli.py --help
```

**Step 1.2: Run Basic Security Analysis**
```bash
# Analyse the unsecure PWA (primary target)
python src/analyser/analyse_cli.py samples/unsecure-pwa

# Run with educational explanations
python src/analyser/analyse_cli.py samples/unsecure-pwa --educational
```

**What You'll See:**

- Educational explanations for each vulnerability type
- Specific file locations and line numbers
- Remediation suggestions

### Activity 2: Input Validation Vulnerability Detection

**Syllabus Focus:** **Input validation** and **defensive data input handling**

**Step 2.1: Analyse Input Validation Issues**
```bash
# Focus on the primary target - unsecure PWA
python src/analyser/analyse_cli.py samples/unsecure-pwa --educational
```

**Step 2.2: Identify Common Input Validation Problems**
Look for these patterns in the analysis results:
- **SQL Injection**: Direct string concatenation in database queries
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: Unescaped user input in templates
- **Path Traversal**: Unvalidated file path inputs
- **Command Injection**: User input passed to system commands

**Step 2.3: Review Specific Findings**
```bash
**Step 5.3: Prioritise and Document Findings**
```bash
# Generate summary report
python src/analyser/analyse_cli.py samples/unsecure-pwa --educational > vulnerability_report.txt

# Review high-priority issues first
grep -A 5 "üö® High:" vulnerability_report.txt
```

## üìä Summary

### Key Vulnerability Types to Identify

Through SAST analysis, you should discover these critical security issues:

**1. SQL Injection (A03 - Injection)**
- **Detection**: String concatenation in SQL queries, missing parameterization
- **Impact**: Database compromise, data theft, unauthorized access
- **Syllabus Connection**: Input validation and sanitization failures

**2. Cross-Site Scripting - XSS (A03 - Injection)**

- **Syllabus Connection**: Secure application configuration and deployment

### Skills Developed

By completing this exercise, you have practiced:
- **Automated security testing**: Using SAST tools for vulnerability detection
- **Vulnerability interpretation**: Understanding and prioritising security findings
- **OWASP Top 10 mapping**: Connecting findings to industry-standard vulnerability categories
- **Remediation planning**: Understanding how to fix common security issues

### Real-World Application

SAST is essential in professional software development because:
- Catches security issues early in the development lifecycle (shift-left security)
- Reduces costs by finding vulnerabilities before deployment
- Provides comprehensive code coverage without execution requirements
- Educates developers about secure coding practices through automated feedback

SAST tools integrate with development workflows and complement **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)** and **manual code review** for comprehensive security coverage.

}
```

### ü§î Self-Check Questions:

Answer these to test your understanding:

1. **What's the difference between the basic and educational output modes?**

   - Basic mode: Shows findings only
   - Educational mode: Shows findings + explanations + how to fix them

2. **Why might you want JSON output instead of human-readable reports?**

   - JSON can be processed by other tools automatically
   - Good for integration with development pipelines
   - Can be imported into databases or reporting systems

3. **How does static analysis differ from manual code review?**
   - Static analysis: Automated, fast, consistent, finds known patterns
   - Manual review: Human judgement, context-aware, finds logic flaws, slower

### ‚ùå Troubleshooting:

**Problem**: Command not found or Python errors **Solution**:

```bash
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment
python --version  # Should show Python 3.8+
ls src/analyser/   # Should show analyse_cli.py
```

**Problem**: No findings or empty output **Solution**: Make sure target
directory exists:

```bash
ls samples/unsecure-pwa/  # Should show Python files
```

## üìã Exercise 2: Analysing the Unsecure PWA

### üéØ Goal: Find and understand real security vulnerabilities

### Step 1: Initial Analysis

**Navigation check:**

```bash
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment
pwd  # Should show /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment
```

**Run comprehensive analysis:**

```bash
python src/analyser/analyse_cli.py samples/unsecure-pwa --educational --verbose
```

**Expected Output (sample):**

```
üîç STATIC APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING (SAST) REPORT
üìÇ Target: samples/unsecure-pwa
üìÖ Scan Date: 2025-XX-XX

üîß Tools Used:

| Weak Authentication | \_\_\_ | High     | A07:2021 - ID/Auth Failures | Easy to break into accounts        |

### üîç Investigation Tasks:

#### Task 2.1: SQL Injection Analysis

**Find SQL injection vulnerabilities:**

```bash
python src/analyser/analyse_cli.py samples/unsecure-pwa --educational | grep -A 5 -B 5 "SQL\|sql"
```

**Expected to see something like:**

```
üö® HIGH SEVERITY
[BANDIT] hardcoded_sql_expressions
üìÅ File: samples/unsecure-pwa/app.py
üìç Line: 89
üéì Educational Note: SQL injection vulnerability - user input is directly concatenated into SQL queries
```

**Your investigation steps:**

1. **Find SQL injection vulnerabilities** - Note the line numbers where they
   occur
2. **Look at the actual code** - Run:
   `cat samples/unsecure-pwa/app.py | sed -n '89p'` (replace 89 with
   actual line number)
3. **Understand the risk** - Attackers could steal all database data or delete
   records
4. **Propose fixes** - Use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation

**Fill out your findings:**

- Line numbers with SQL injection: ******\_\_\_******
- How many SQL injection issues found: ****\_\_\_****
- Most dangerous SQL injection (line **\_): **\_****

#### Task 2.2: Authentication Issues

**Find authentication weaknesses:**

```bash
python src/analyser/analyse_cli.py samples/unsecure-pwa --educational | grep -A 3 -B 3 "auth\|password\|login"
```

**Investigation steps:**

1. **Identify authentication weaknesses** in the findings
2. **Examine password handling** - Look for weak hashing or plaintext passwords
3. **Check session management** - Look for insecure session handling
4. **Evaluate the security impact** - Could attackers easily break into user
   accounts?

**Expected findings might include:**

- Weak password hashing (using MD5 instead of bcrypt)
- Missing rate limiting on login attempts
- Insecure session management

**Fill out your findings:**

- Password vulnerabilities found: ******\_\_\_\_******
- Session management issues: ********\_\_\_********

```

**Investigation steps:**

1. **Find configuration-related vulnerabilities**
2. **Understand why debug mode is dangerous** - It can expose source code and
   allow remote code execution
3. **Identify other insecure configurations** - Look for hardcoded secrets, weak
   security settings

**Common configuration problems:**

- Debug mode enabled (app.run(debug=True))
- Hardcoded secret keys
- Insecure cookie settings
- Missing security headers

**Fill out your findings:**

- Debug mode issues: ************\_\_\_************
- Hardcoded secrets found: ********\_\_\_\_********
- Other config problems: **********\_\_**********

**Task**: Using the SAST tools and techniques learned, create a security
assessment report that includes:

1. **Executive Summary** (for management)

   - Overall risk level
   - Key findings summary
   - Recommended actions

2. **Technical Findings** (for developers)

   - Detailed vulnerability descriptions
   - Code locations and line numbers
   - Specific remediation steps

3. **Remediation Roadmap** (for project planning)
   - Priority-ordered action items
   - Estimated effort for each fix
   - Timeline recommendations

### üèÜ Advanced Challenge:

**Create Your Own SAST Rule**

1. **Identify a security pattern** not caught by existing tools
2. **Write a detection rule** (conceptually, or using Semgrep syntax)
3. **Test it against the sample applications**
4. **Document your rule** with examples and remediation advice

Example Semgrep rule structure:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: your-custom-rule
    pattern: dangerous_function($VAR)
    message: Security issue detected
    severity: HIGH
    languages: [python]
```
