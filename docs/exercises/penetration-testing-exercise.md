**This exercise is for educational purposes only and must be conducted in the provided controlled environment.**

### Ethical Hacking Principles
1. **Permission**: Only test systems you own or have explicit written permission to test
2. **Scope**: Stay within the defined scope of testing (this sandbox environment only)
3. **Documentation**: Document all activities for learning and accountability
4. **Responsibility**: Report findings responsibly and help improve security
5. **No Harm**: Never cause damage or disruption to systems or data

### Legal Responsibilities
- **Never** use these techniques against systems you don't own
- **Always** obtain written permission before testing any system
- **Report** vulnerabilities through proper channels
- **Respect** privacy and confidentiality of any data encountered
- **Follow** your organization's security policies and procedures
