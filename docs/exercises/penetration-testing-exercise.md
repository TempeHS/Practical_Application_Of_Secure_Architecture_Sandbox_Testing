## üõ°Ô∏è Ethical Guidelines and Legal Considerations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - Read Before Proceeding

**This exercise is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY and must be conducted in the provided controlled environment.**

**Think of this like learning to be a "good guy" security guard who tests locks and alarms to make sure they work properly.**

### Ethical Hacking Principles (Memorize These!)
1. **Permission**: Only test systems you own or have explicit written permission to test
2. **Scope**: Stay within the defined scope of testing (this sandbox environment only)
3. **Documentation**: Document all activities for learning and accountability
4. **Responsibility**: Report findings responsibly and help improve security
5. **No Harm**: Never cause damage or disruption to systems or data

### Legal Responsibilities (This Is Serious!)
- **NEVER** use these techniques against systems you don't own
- **ALWAYS** obtain written permission before testing any system
- **REPORT** vulnerabilities through proper channels
- **RESPECT** privacy and confidentiality of any data encountered
- **FOLLOW** your organization's security policies and procedures

### üìù Student Ethics Agreement
**Before continuing, write and sign this agreement:**

```
I, [Your Name], understand that:
‚úÖ These techniques are for learning cybersecurity defense only
‚úÖ I will NEVER use these skills on systems I don't own  
‚úÖ I will NEVER access computers, networks, or accounts without permission
‚úÖ I will report any real vulnerabilities through proper channels
‚úÖ I understand that unauthorized computer access is a serious crime
‚úÖ I will only use these techniques in this controlled practice environment

## üìã Exercise Overview

This comprehensive penetration testing exercise integrates all previous security analysis methods:
- **Phase 1: Reconnaissance** - Information gathering using network analysis (like casing a building)
- **Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment** - Combining SAST, DAST, and sandbox findings (like finding weak locks)
- **Phase 3: Exploitation** - Controlled exploitation of identified vulnerabilities (like testing if weak locks actually open)
- **Phase 4: Post-Exploitation** - Understanding impact and maintaining access (like seeing what you could access)
- **Phase 5: Reporting** - Professional documentation and recommendations (like writing a security report)

## üîç Phase 1: Reconnaissance (45 minutes)
