# Organizational Vulnerability Assessment Exercise

## üìñ Overview

Organizational vulnerability assessment evaluates the people, processes, and technology practices that contribute to an organization's overall security posture. While technical testing finds code vulnerabilities, organizational assessment identifies systemic security weaknesses in how security is managed, implemented, and maintained.

**Think of it this way:** If technical security testing is like checking individual locks and alarms in a building, organizational vulnerability assessment is like evaluating the entire security management system - who has keys, how security policies are enforced, how staff are trained, and how security incidents are handled.

**This exercise aligns with these syllabus points:**
- **6.1.1 Implement security management processes** - Comprehensive evaluation of security governance and management
- **6.1.2 Analyze security requirements** - Assessment of organizational security requirements and compliance
- **6.2.1 Implement secure network architecture** - Reviewing architectural decisions and technology choices
- **6.2.2 Implement secure protocols** - Evaluating protocol security within organizational context

## üéØ Prerequisites

### Technical Requirements
- Completion of all previous security exercises (Manual Code Review, SAST, DAST, Network Analysis, Sandbox Analysis, Penetration Testing)
- Understanding of security governance and risk management concepts
- Familiarity with security policy development and implementation

### Case Study Context
You will use the **Unsecure PWA** application as a case study to conduct organizational assessment:

```bash
# Navigate to the case study application
cd /workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment/samples/unsecure-pwa

# Review the application structure
ls -la
```

This represents evaluating an organization that developed and deployed this application with multiple security vulnerabilities.

### Assessment Methodology

You will use multiple evaluation approaches:

- **Document Review**: Policies, procedures, standards
- **Process Analysis**: Development workflow, security integration
- **Gap Analysis**: Current state vs. security best practices
- **Risk Assessment**: Business impact and likelihood evaluation
- **Maturity Assessment**: Security program maturity level

## üìã Assessment Framework

This organizational assessment is structured differently from technical exercises because it focuses on strategic evaluation rather than hands-on testing. You will conduct a comprehensive multi-part assessment covering:
