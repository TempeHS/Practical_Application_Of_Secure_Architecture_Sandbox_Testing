### Finding 1

#### ![HIGH](https://img.shields.io/badge/HIGH-orange?style=flat) flask_debug_true

![bandit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tool-bandit-blue?style=flat)

**Description:** A Flask app appears to be run with debug=True, which exposes the Werkzeug debugger and allows the execution of arbitrary code.

**Location:** `/workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment/samples/unsecure-pwa/main.py:70`

**CWE ID:** [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)

#### ![HIGH](https://img.shields.io/badge/HIGH-orange?style=flat) Avoiding SQL string concatenation: untrusted input concatenated with raw SQL query can result in SQL Injection. In order to execute raw query safely, prepared statement should be used. SQLAlchemy provides TextualSQL to easily used prepared statement with named parameters. For complex SQL composition, use SQL Expression Language or Schema Definition Language. In most cases, SQLAlchemy ORM will be a better option.

![bandit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tool-bandit-blue?style=flat)

**Description:** Possible SQL injection vector through string-based query construction.

**Location:** `/workspaces/Secure_Architecture_Sandbox_Testing_Environment/samples/unsecure-pwa/user_management.py:20`

**CWE ID:** [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

##### üìö Educational Explanation

Imagine a library where you can request books by filling out a form. Normally, you'd write 'Harry Potter' and the librarian would find that book. But what if you wrote 'Harry Potter; also give me all books and customer information'? If the librarian blindly follows your request without questioning the extra commands, you'd get access to everything in the library!

üéØ Focus: SQL injection is like tricking a database into running extra commands by disguising them as normal search requests. It's like asking for a book but secretly also asking for the keys to the entire library.

##### üîß How to Fix This

Replace all dynamic SQL with parameterized queries ‚Ä¢ Implement input validation for all user inputs ‚Ä¢ Use ORM frameworks when possible

**Confidence:** MEDIUM
